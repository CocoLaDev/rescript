# ReScript Project

This project is a cryptography library built to handle key cryptographic operations such as private/public key pair generation, data verification, encryption, decryption, and hashing. Additionally, the library bridges TypeScript libraries and functions into the ReScript ecosystem, allowing seamless integration between the two languages.
